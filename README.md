## About the Project
The NYU Marketplace is a platform for buying and selling items between NYU students. It is a web application that allows users to create listings, browse listings, and purchase items. It is built with Django and React.

## Key Features
*List the high-level Epics or capabilities delivered.*
- **User Authentication:** Secure login via NYU credentials.
- **Product Listing:** Create, edit, and delete items with image upload support.
- **Search & Filtering:** Advanced filtering by category, price, and condition.
- **Transaction Management:** Secure checkout flow (integration with Stripe/Mock payment).
- **User Profiles:** Dashboard for managing listings and order history.

## Tech Stack
This project leverages a modern, scalable architecture deployed on AWS.

| Category | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React 19.2, Vite, Bootstrap 5.3 |
| **Backend** | Django 5.2.7, Django REST Framework (DRF) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Production) / MySQL (Local) |
| **DevOps/Cloud** | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Travis CI, Coveralls |
| **Project Mgmt** | Zenhub, GitHub |
## Getting Started

### Backend — Django

#### Dependency Management with UV

We use [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python package management. UV is compatible with both Python 3.11 and 3.13.

**Note:** We use `requirements.txt` for dependency management instead of `pyproject.toml` because AWS Elastic Beanstalk (our deployment platform) expects and automatically installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

#### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

#### Setting Up Virtual Environment

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
uv venv --python 3.11 .venv311

# Or use Python 3.13
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv311/bin/activate
```

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Updating Dependencies

To update all packages to their latest compatible versions:

```bash
cd backend

# Compile latest versions (maintains compatibility across Python versions)
uv pip compile requirements.in --upgrade -o requirements.txt

# Then install the updated requirements
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.in` file contains high-level dependencies with flexible version constraints. UV resolves these to specific versions in `requirements.txt` that work across Python 3.11 and 3.13.

### Running Django

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate # create/update database schema (necessary anytime you pull new code that includes new migrations, or you changed models)
python manage.py runserver # start the development server
```

## Frontend — React (Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev # start the development server
```

## Agile & Scrum Process
> *This section documents our adherence to Scrum principles and course constraints.*

We followed a strict **1-week Sprint** cycle (Tuesday to Monday) to ensure rapid feedback and continuous delivery.

### Sprint Structure
- **Sprint Planning:** Tuesdays.
- **Daily Scrums:** Brief sync-ups to identify blockers.
- **Sprint Review & Demo:** Mondays. Live demonstration of working software to the Product Owner and Instructor.
- **Retrospective:** Mondays. Inspect and adapt our process.

### Estimation Strategy
We use a modified Fibonacci scale restricted to **0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3** points to encourage breaking down tasks into small, manageable units. A "3" implies the story is too large and must be split.

## Development Workflow
We utilize the **Forking Workflow** to maintain a pristine `main` branch.

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Developers work on their independent forks.
2.  **Branching:** Feature branches follow the naming convention `feature/<issue-id>-short-description`.
3.  **Pull Requests (PR):** - PRs must be linked to a Zenhub User Story/Issue.
    - Requires at least 1 peer review before merging.
    - Must pass all automated tests (local/CI).
4.  **Definition of Done (DoD):**
    - [ ] Unit tests passed.
    - [ ] Pass all tests
    - [ ] Ensure coverage > 85%
    - [ ] Linted with black/flake8/eslint
    - [ ] Deployable to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - [ ] Pass CI/CD pipeline
    - [ ] Code reviewed and approved
